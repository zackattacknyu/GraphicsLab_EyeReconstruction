EM algorithm will be good for clustering
- also try morphology filter

Bilaterial filtering will be good for taking out the noise later
Median filteringwould also be good to try

Think about histeresis and see what occurs

Notes about correlation: 
- When I tried correlating with an image patch, there 
	was a significant shift in the object centers.
- This shift does not represent the shift between two consecutive images
